        In my free time, I busy myself with hands on activities such as
        tinkering with my motorcycles and cars. I thoroughly enjoy racing
        motorcycles and enhancing their capabilities be it through aero dynamic
        modifications or weight reduction. My position as Captain during weekend
        football sessions has been instrumental in honing my decision-making
        skills under pressure. Through delegating player positions and
        motivating the team, I have become adept at transformational leadership.
        Being a competitive individual, football allows me to compete with my
        friends as well as making it a very sociable activity.
